# Hexagon IllusionðŸ¤ª
Hexagonal illusion, is a small pencil that represents an illusion based on a grouping of 18 white hexagons and 2 brown hexagons to give a wooden base, similar to classic board games.

By moving the mouse and selecting the central hexagon, it is possible to move said hexagon around the board and without being able to visualize the illusion. Also if you double click on the central hexagon, the hexagons will rotate in seconds.
